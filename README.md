üìñ Project Overview
The Simple Q&A Chatbot with RAG and LangChain is designed to understand and answer questions based on the content of PDF documents, such as course materials or company documentation. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system retrieves relevant document content and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide contextually accurate answers.

This project integrates cutting-edge tools like LangChain for document processing and embeddings, Qdrant for vector storage, and a web interface for user interactions.

üéØ Goals
